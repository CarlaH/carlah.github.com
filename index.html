          <h3>Pattern Mining in Movement Data</h3>

        <p>I wrote my bachelor thesis at the Ludiwig-Maximilian University in 2012. Here you will find all my 
        data and code.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>KinectCollectingData</strong> The program to collect data is based on the Microsoft 
        Sample `SkeletonViewer' contained in the SDK Beta v2. It was written in C\#. To record simply connect 
        the Kinect camera to your computer and start the program. You can watch the pictures from the depth 
        camera, the normal video view and one or two moving skeletons. When closing the program the collected 
        joints are written to some csv-files, each containing the moves of only one skeleton.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> Our data was recorded in bellydance lessons for beginners. Overall we 
        recorded sixteen hours of dance training. The csv-files contain one line per frame, each starting 
        with the time since begin of the recording followed by the coordinates of the twenty joints. Each 
        joint has four coordinates: x, y and z as for normal coordinates in 3D and a fourth coordinate w, 
        that should indicate the quality of the recognition of this joint. Yet w appeared to be always 1. 
        For more details on the recorded data see chapter 3 of my Bachelor Thesis.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Viewer</strong> The viewer is a modification of the code of 
        <a href="http://blog.aleksandarrodic.com/?p=4">Alexander Rodic</a>. It uses 
        javascript and nodejs to realize a server, that reads in one file of the collected data (the path 
        is specified in the code). The client.html has javascript embedded, too. The skeleton is 
        drawn using WebGL and the data is fetched from the server. The framerate can be adjusted in the file 
        client.js at the very end. We also implemented some jumping methods - open client.html so see how 
        to use them.</li>
        <li><strong>BA</strong> The programs to read the data, coarse it, encode them and search for patterns 
        are written in Java. We also used the 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained">guava-libraries</a> from google 
        to faciliate e.g. the file writing. The different versions of the program can be found when browsing 
        the history, starting with the simple window shift approach and ending with the iSAX encoding. 
        The two resulting files in the final version contain annotations to simplify the understanding of the 
        values. By modifying the toString()-methods of the classes Point and Breakpoint these files can be 
        cleaned and thus be easier to handle when reading them in again.
