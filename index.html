          <h3>Pattern Mining in Movement Data</h3>

        <p>I wrote my bachelor thesis at the Ludiwig-Maximilian University in 2012. Here you will find all my 
        data and code.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>KinectCollectingData</strong> contains the Code I used to write the Joints that
        were recognized by Kinect into csv-files. A file consists of the time in miliseconds since the start of the 
          recording followed by the twenty joints. One joint is represented by four coordinates: x, y and z as
          for usual points in 3D and the coordinate w, that should indicate how sure the joint was recognized.
          Yet, w is always 1, so I ignored it.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> simply containes all the movement data I collected, either plain or
          encoded via iSAX encoding.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Viewer</strong> contains the Viewer I used to take a look at the data.</li>
        <li><strong>BA</strong> contains the code I used to find patterns. You'll find different states of the
          code in the history. More information can be found in my Thesis
        </li>
        </ul>
